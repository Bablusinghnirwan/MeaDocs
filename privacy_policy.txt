We only access the following information locally on your device to support app functionality:

These files remain on your device at all times

No file is uploaded to any cloud or remote server

No data is transmitted over the internet

1.2 Local App Data

To improve your experience, MeaDocs may store certain non-personal information locally, such as:

Recently accessed files (optional)

This information is stored strictly on your device and never leaves it.

MeaDocs does not use:

Online servers

Text extraction

Image-to-text operations

All processing stays offline and isolated to your device.

However:

All such tools execute locally

No third-party receives your data

6. Data Security

Since all data remains local, the main security responsibility lies with your device’s environment.
We recommend:

Using updated antivirus software

Keeping your operating system secure

Avoiding suspicious or untrusted files

MeaDocs does not have access to or control over your local files.

7. Children’s Privacy

MeaDocs is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
Since the application collects no data, no child-specific information is stored or processed.

8. Your Rights

Because we do not collect or store personal information:

You fully control all data processed within the app

We cannot access, modify, or delete your information

Uninstalling MeaDocs removes all locally stored application data (excluding files you manually saved)

9. Updates to This Policy
